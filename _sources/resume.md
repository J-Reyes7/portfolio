## Projects  

### **Spanish to English Neural Machine Translation**  
- Wrote a story in fluent Spanish and used a pretrained LLM from Hugging Face’s Transformers library to generate English translations.  
- Leveraged Spanish and English fluency to evaluate translation quality and identify recurring errors.  
- Explored TensorFlow Hub and Keras for customizing and fine-tuning LLMs.  

### **Using MLOps and Database Techniques for Cancer Detection**  
- [A video of a 15-minute presentation I gave can be found here.](#)  
- Used Python to parse large unstructured data files.  
- Created a 3NF normalized SQLite database to store patient data.  
- Queried and loaded data into Pandas for analysis and modeling.  
- Utilized Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to create visualizations, data pipelines, and ML models.  
- Logged experiments with DagsHub/MLFlow and deployed the optimal model using Docker and Streamlit to create a shareable web app.
